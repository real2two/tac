# What are "parts" and how do you make them?

Parts are the things that make up the game.  
You can make parts with text, images, custom fonts, keybinds and many more!

In the source code, "part$" is the variable that controls which part you are in, which is useful for custom coding a part, as in maybe make a game with both text adventure and moving graphics.

All parts \(besides custom coded parts\) are edited in the folder, "data\game\".

Making a folder in "data\game\" means you make a unstable part. 🎉Yay!🎉

After you make the part, there are many things you can add to the part.
