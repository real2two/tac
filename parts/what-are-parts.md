# What are "parts"?

Parts are the things that make up the game.  
You can make parts with text, images, custom fonts, keybinds and many more!

In the source code, "part$" is the variable that controls which part you are in, which is useful for custom coding a part, as in maybe make a game with both text adventure and moving graphics.
