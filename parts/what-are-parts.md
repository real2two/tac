# What are "parts" and how do you make them?

## What are parts?

Parts are the things that make up the game.  
You can make parts with text, images, custom fonts, keybinds and many more!

## How does the part work through the code?

In the source code, "part$" is the variable that controls which part you are in, which is useful for custom coding a part, as in maybe make a game with both text adventure and moving graphics.

Of course, there is multiple more processes that read the code/files \(input\) and sends the output to the program. If you want to know exactly how the program works, read the code and learn QB64.

## How do I edit a part?

All parts \(besides custom coded parts\) are edited in the folder, "data\game\".

Making a folder in "data\game\" means you make a unstable part. ðŸŽ‰Yay!ðŸŽ‰

After you make the part, there are many things you can add to the part. The main thing you need to know is the part types.
