# "actions" folder

The "actions" folder is important. It is one of the most important things that manages going to other parts in the game.

You need to simply make a folder called "actions" in the part folder \(aka "data\game\&lt;part name&gt;\"\).

Now, you make multiple \(or single depending on how many key actions you want\) files.

## Adding an Action Key

You have to make a file called "&lt;any key button, do not use more than 1 letter/number/symbol&gt;.\(filetype\)" inside the "actions" folder.

{% hint style="info" %}
Whatever you put on "&lt;any key button, do not use more than 1 letter/number/symbol&gt;" is the action key.
{% endhint %}

Now, you edit the file and enter the part name where you want the player to go to when you click on the action key. Only the first line of the file will be read.

You're done! This can be edited while the program is running.
