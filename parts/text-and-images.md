# Text and Images

Text and images are important to the game. They are the visuals and what the player sees in the game.

## text.\(filetype\)

You can put "text.\(filetype\)" in your part folder. This is used to make text in the program. Text overlap images in TAC.

```text
Whatever text here. # extremely long text might go out of the screen, making it invisible
x of where the first letter starts. # must be a number (less than the size of the x of the screen but more than or equal to 0)
y of where the first letter starts. # must be a number (less than the size of the x of the screen but more than or equal to 0)
foreground color of the text
background color of the text # leave this as "?" to not set the background color.
font file (fonts must in the folder "data\fonts\") # leave this as "?" to set it as the default font.
font size 
```

## images.\(filetype\)
