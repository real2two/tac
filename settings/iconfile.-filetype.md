# iconfile.\(filetype\)

In the folder "data\settings\", you can see a file called "iconfile.\(filetype\)" \(or something like that\). That file is used to set the icon image of the program.

## There doesn't need to be a icon.

You can delete the file "iconfile.\(filetype\)" \(or something like that\) to not set a custom icon, but use the default icon of the program.

## Set a icon.

First of all, you need a image and the file. In the file, put the image name and extension. For example, you'd write "icon.png" if the icon image's name and extension is "icon.png". "icon" would be the image's name and the extension with be ".png". Now, enter the image file into "data\images", if not already. Try testing your program with everything else stable \(as in used properly\). 

## All icons must be in the folder "data\images\".

In fact, all images must be in the folder "data\images\". This is made to organize the images and everything else from each other. It isn't tested, but subfolders in the folder "data\images\" is possible as long as you write in "data\settings\iconfile.\(filetype\)" this slash, "\", instead of "/" in the file to read a image from a subfolder.
