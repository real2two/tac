description: Set the length and width of the program.

# screen.\(filetype\)

First of all, the screen is what the size of the program is.   
Second of all, the screen is in 32 bits \(that means the program is 32-bits\), so the program won't go crazy.  
Third of all, if the computer you are using has a lower screen than the program, it won't look good.

## Setting the screen.

This is pretty much self explanatory.   
This needs to be the setup of the code.

```text
length, width
```

Here's something simple to know.  
x = length  
y = width

Hope this was easy to do.
