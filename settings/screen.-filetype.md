# screen.\(filetype\)

First of all, the screen is what the size of the program is.   
Second of all, the screen is in 32 bits \(that means the program is 32-bits\), so the program won't go crazy.  
Third of all, if the computer you are using has a lower screen than the program, it won't look good.
