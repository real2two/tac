# startpart.\(filetype\)

"data\settings\startpart.\(filetype\)" is used to set the part you start with.

This is defaultly set as "start". The start part is the part name listed in the first line of the file.

In the file, you need to put the part that starts with. You should learn how to make a part before editing this file.

For example, you made a part called "startingphase" and you want to make that part be the first part. You have to put in the file "startingphase" and it will be the first part of the game.
