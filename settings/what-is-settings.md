# What is "settings"?

There are game settings. If you downloaded TAC, you should see the folder called "data\settings\", which contain 4 files.

* iconfile.\(filetype\)
  * This is used to change the icon file of the program. If this file does not exist, it will show the default logo. The icon picture file must be in the folder "data\images\". All image file extensions are not supported!
* screen.\(filetype\)
  * You can change the length and width of the program. It should defaultly be set as "500, 400". The screen should only be numbers and have only 1 comma. It will ignore text after the 1st comma. This file is required.
* startpart.\(filetype\)
  * This is the first part you will start in. You can manage your parts in "data\game\", which is explained in another guide in this documentation. This file is required.
* title.\(filetype\)
  * You can set the title of your program. This file is required.
