# Download

You need to first download the program for the text adventure game to work. Github page: [https://github.com/text-adventure-creator/stable](https://github.com/text-adventure-creator/stable) Instant download: [https://github.com/text-adventure-creator/text-adventure-creator/stable/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/text-adventure-creator/text-adventure-creator/stable/archive/master.zip)

First, you need to extract the files. After you finish that, you can delete these following files: LICENSE, README.md and SUMMARY.md. Do not delete any files inside TAC Project yet.

There is a file called **game.bas** and **game.exe**. **game.bas** is the source code. If you don't know how to code QB64 and won't code a single part of your text adventure game, you can delete this file. The recommended editor to see the source code is the QB64 editor, but you can see it in another text file reading and editor too, but won't be able to update/run the new code.

There is a file called **game.exe**. That is the program used to run the program. You don't need to modify **game.exe** in any way to make the text adventure game.

There is also a folder called "data". That is where all your data is stored.

If you are a Linux or macOS user, there is another guide that teaches you how to run the program using Linux or macOS.
